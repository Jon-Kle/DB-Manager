# Contributing to DB-Manager

**Hey**, thanks for thinking of contributing to our project!

However this is an internal school project and there is not that much work to do for everyone...
But if you see an issue with the tag `external help wanted`, you are welcome to help us.

### If you work on the code please:
- try to keep the general form of the messages in the CLI 
- describe in the PR what changes you have made and keep it to those only
- don't re-format the code
